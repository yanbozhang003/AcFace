# AcFace

This project introduces a novel acoustic-based facial recognition system designed to deliver exceptional performance even under conditions where facial masks obscure parts of the face. The system is built around two primary components:

1. **Signal Processing Module**: This module processes raw acoustic signals to create precise 3D representations of faces. It is engineered to accurately capture facial features, ensuring the system's effectiveness even when traditional visual cues are partially hidden.

2. **Deep Learning Model**: This component is responsible for the recognition and differentiation of faces based on the 3D representations generated by the signal processing module. It has been meticulously trained to maintain high accuracy levels, specifically in scenarios involving facial masks.

The diagram below offers a visual overview of the system's architecture.

Within this repository, we offer a comprehensive suite of tools required to deploy this system, including the signal processing algorithms essential for extracting facial spectrums and the deep learning framework for spectrum analysis and recognition. Furthermore, we have included a specially curated dataset to facilitate the evaluation of the system's performance across a diverse range of scenarios.

## Code overview

This section outlines the key components of our codebase and their functionalities. The implementations of the two primary components are introduced separately in below.

## Usage

Using the AcFace framework for face recognition requires executing three main modules: Facial scanning, Facial spectrum derivation, and RD-Net processing (including training and testing). Below, we will introduce the operational methods of these three modules in three parts.

### Facial Scanning

Facial scanning is the initial step in our process. It involves controlling the grove-speaker to transmit signals and utilizing the UMA-16 microphone array to receive signals.

#### Starting the UMA-16

To prepare the UMA-16 for operation, use the following command to set it to standby mode:

```bash
./startAudioRecorder.sh -f <filename> -d <device> -r <duration> -s <sample rate> -n <num channels>
```

The options for this command are defined as follows:

``` 
Options:
    -f <filename>           Specify the path and filename for the recording. Default is 'Rx_file'.
    -d <device>             Specify the device name. Default is 'nanoSHARC micArray16 UAC2.0'.
    -r <duration>           Specify the recording duration in seconds. Default is 5.
    -s <sample rate>        Specify the sample rate in Hz. Default is 48000.
    -n <num channels>       Specify the number of channels. Default is 16.
```

Use the `-h` option to view the definitions of these options.

#### Transmitting the Acoustic Signal

With the UMA-16 ready, begin transmitting the acoustic signal necessary for facial scanning. Control of the speaker is managed through commands provided by the seeed-voicecard. The seeed-voicecard can be installed from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/HinTak/seeed-voicecard).

After setting up on an RPI (Raspberry Pi), use the following command to play the audio file:

```bash
aplay -D <device> -r <sample rate> <filename>
```

The options for this command are detailed below:

``` 
Options:
    -D <device>             Specify the device name. Default is 'plughw:1,0'.
    -r <sample rate>        Specify the sample rate in Hz. Default is 48000.
    <filename>              Specify the path and filename for storing the audio file.
```

### Facial spectrum derivation

This module processes the received raw samples and derives facial spectrums. It takes in the raw signal and experimental settings (define the settings under `Spectrum derivation/settings/` ) as the input, and calls multiple functions for facial spectrum derivation. 

To start the processing, execute:

```
./startFsProc.sh -s ./settings/ -g ./signal/ -u user1 -m 0
```

The options for this command are detailed below:

``` 
Options:
    -s <settings_folder>   Specify the settings folder path. Default is "./settings/".
    -g <signal_folder>     Specify the signal folder path. Default is "./signal/".
    -u <USER>              Specify the user index, e.g., "user1".
    -m <MASK>              Specify the mask indicator, "1" means with mask, "0" means without mask.
```

### RD-Net processing

Last but not least, RD-Net serves the purpose of accurate and robust facial spectrum recognition. The core of RD-Net is a recognizer-discriminator design, which is optimized for maximal recognition accuracy and minimized mask distinguishing capabiilty. 

The training process can be started by executing the following command:

```
./model_train.sh -d <data folder> -b <batch size> -l <learning rate> -e <num epochs> -m <model folder>
```

The options for this command are detailed below:

``` 
Options:
    -d <data folder>       Specify the directory for data. Default is "./data". 
    -b <batch size>        Specify the batch size. Default is 32.
    -l <learning rate>     Specify the learning rate. Default is 0.001.
    -e <num epochs>        Specify the number of epochs. Default is 30.
    -m <model path>        Specify the path for model saving. Default is "./model.pth"
```

After training completes, you can start model testing by executing the following command:

```
./model_test.sh -d <data folder> -m <model path>
```

The definition of these two arguments is the same as they are in `model_train.sh`.

abstract = {The accuracy of vision-based face recognition suffers in challenging scenarios, such as foggy or smoky weather, poor lighting, and blockage by objects like facial masks. This paper proposes an acoustic-based facial recognition system based on acoustic facial spectrum - a novel acoustic representation of human faces in 3D space. Specifically, we divide the 3D space into cubes and profile the distribution of the acoustic signal reflected by the human face inside each cube. Generating such a per-cube acoustic profile is challenging in relating each reflected signal path back to the physical location of its reflecting cube. To address the challenge, we propose a novel multipath resolving algorithm that is capable of distinguishing signal reflection happened within different cube. Based on the facial spectrum, we propose a discriminator-recognizer network that can robustly recognize human faces under varying face-microphone distances or even in presence of facial mask blockage. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves over 95\% average recognition accuracy for cases with and without mask blockage.
